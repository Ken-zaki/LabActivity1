This program is kinda confusing base from my perspective:

to made it understandable:

Every time we add a new node:

we can just pick number base from the choices

but if we want to add a node in position 
we simply just put a number from the current List:

Example : 11 22 33 44 55

and i want to put the value of 66 between in 22 and 33, to put it in there, just put the number 33 on the target value to put the new node.

Same process in delete node....
